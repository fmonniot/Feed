# Feed — Visual specification

This document is the **visual reference** for Feed, a self-hosted RSS reader with a web client and an Android client. It describes how the design looks and why it looks that way, independently of any codebase.

The story board at [story-board/index.html](story-board/index.html) is the **canonical visual source of truth**. Read this doc, but keep the story board open: serve `index.html` and click into the **Paper** desktop artboard and the **Paper** Android artboard. Where this spec gives a pixel value, that value is what produces the look in the story board; where it gives reasoning, that reasoning is meant to help you extrapolate into screens or states this doc doesn't cover.

The behavioural contract lives in [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md) (sibling to this file). When this spec and FEATURES.md disagree — for example, if this spec describes a UI element for a feature FEATURES.md has dropped — **FEATURES.md wins**. This visual spec describes only what the story board actually renders today, against the current FEATURES.md.

## The design in one paragraph

Feed wants to look like **a paper notebook, not an app**. Quiet, serif-led, low-chroma, no visual noise competing with the article text. Everything that isn't the article itself recedes: hairline borders instead of shadows, one muted slate accent instead of a brand colour, unicode-weight icons instead of filled glyphs, no animation, no surface gradients, no rounded card aesthetic, no decorative imagery. The reader pane is the protagonist of the screen at all times.

When you have a choice between two implementations, **pick the quieter one.**

## Palette — "Paper"

A low-chroma cool grey-white system. Every surface across both platforms uses these eleven tokens. There is no second palette, no dark mode, no theme picker — Paper is the entire palette.

| Token | Hex / value | OKLCH (where colour) | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bg` | `#f3f5f7` | L 96.9 · C .003 · h 248 | Page background ("paper") |
| `panel` | `#f9fafb` | L 98.5 · C .002 · h 248 | Sidebar, selected-row tint, input fields, popovers, button backgrounds |
| `border` | `rgba(20, 25, 40, 0.08)` | — | Hairline dividers, input + button borders |
| `borderStrong` | `rgba(20, 25, 40, 0.16)` | — | Popover outlines, login form field underlines |
| `ink` | `#1a1f28` | L 23.8 · C .019 · h 262 | Body text, headlines, primary buttons |
| `ink2` | `#4a5160` | L 43.4 · C .026 · h 266 | Secondary text (excerpts, author, button labels) |
| `ink3` | `#7c8290` | L 60.6 · C .022 · h 267 | Tertiary text (timestamps, captions, hint copy) |
| `muted` | `rgba(20, 25, 40, 0.5)` | — | Sidebar counts |
| `accent` | `#566073` | L 48.8 · C .033 · h 263 | Active nav, selected indicator, unread dot, link colour, primary-button fill on Subscriptions |
| `accentSoft` | `rgba(86, 96, 115, 0.10)` | — | Active-nav background, active mobile-tab pill |
| `onAccent` | `#f9fafb` | — | Text/icons on solid `accent` fills |
| `danger` | `#a05050` | L 47.6 · C .076 · h 23 | Destructive actions only (Logout button, Delete menu item, login error border) |

### Reasoning

- The palette is **cool grey** — every neutral token sits in OKLCH hue 248–267. This is deliberate; warm-grey paper feels nostalgic, cool-grey paper feels current and screen-native. Don't shift the hue.
- The accent is **not a brand colour.** It's a muted slate. The design has no second accent. If you find yourself reaching for one, you're solving the wrong problem — use `ink2` or `ink3` instead.
- `border` is **alpha**, not a solid value. This matters: it composites over `bg` and `panel` differently, which is what keeps dividers feeling like hairlines rather than lines. Don't flatten to a solid hex.
- `danger` is the **only saturated colour anywhere in the system.** It is reserved for destructive paths — the Logout row, the Delete menu item in subscription overflow, and the inline auth-error border on login. Do not use it for anything else.
- Body text on `bg` (`ink` on `#f3f5f7`) has a contrast ratio of ~12:1, well above WCAG AAA. Secondary `ink2` is ~7:1. `ink3` for timestamps is ~4.5:1 — readable, intentionally lower contrast so timestamps don't compete with titles.

### Rules of thumb

Body text uses `ink`. Metadata uses `ink2`. Timestamps, labels, and footer chrome use `ink3`. The accent is **never used as a fill for large surfaces** — only for 1–2px indicators (the selected-row inset bar, the active-nav pill, the unread dot) and small text on links and active states.

### Tokens as CSS custom properties

```css
:root {
  --bg:            #f3f5f7;
  --panel:         #f9fafb;
  --border:        rgba(20, 25, 40, 0.08);
  --border-strong: rgba(20, 25, 40, 0.16);
  --ink:           #1a1f28;
  --ink-2:         #4a5160;
  --ink-3:         #7c8290;
  --muted:         rgba(20, 25, 40, 0.5);
  --accent:        #566073;
  --accent-soft:   rgba(86, 96, 115, 0.10);
  --on-accent:     #f9fafb;
  --danger:        #a05050;
}
```

### Tokens as Jetpack Compose

```kotlin
object FeedColors {
  val bg            = Color(0xFFF3F5F7)
  val panel         = Color(0xFFF9FAFB)
  val border        = Color(0x14141928)         // alpha 0.08 over neutral 0x141928
  val borderStrong  = Color(0x29141928)         // alpha 0.16
  val ink           = Color(0xFF1A1F28)
  val ink2          = Color(0xFF4A5160)
  val ink3          = Color(0xFF7C8290)
  val muted         = Color(0x80141928)         // alpha 0.50
  val accent        = Color(0xFF566073)
  val accentSoft    = Color(0x1A566073)         // alpha 0.10
  val onAccent      = Color(0xFFF9FAFB)
  val danger        = Color(0xFFA05050)
}
```

Wire these into a Compose `ColorScheme` (Material 3) by mapping `bg → background`, `panel → surface / surfaceVariant`, `ink → onBackground / onSurface`, `accent → primary`, `onAccent → onPrimary`, `danger → error`. The mapping is approximate. **No-Material rule:** map the palette into Material's `ColorScheme` so existing Compose components (text fields, sliders, dialogs) still pick up the right colours, but do not adopt Material 3 components, elevation, ripple, or motion. The aesthetic is editorial — paper, hairlines, no shadows, no tonal surfaces. The single exception is the snackbar (see §Toasts / snackbars below); everything else is built directly from the primitives in this doc.

## Typography

Two families. Both load from Google Fonts in the story board; **bundle them into the production app** rather than relying on Google.

- **Serif — `Source Serif 4`** (opsz 8..60, weights 400 / 500 / 600). Fallback: `"Source Serif Pro", "Iowan Old Style", Georgia, serif`. Used for all headlines, article titles, article body, italic emphasis, the wordmark, the avatar letters in subscriptions, and the bottom-tab glyphs on mobile.
- **Sans — `IBM Plex Sans`** (weights 400 / 500 / 600). Fallback: `ui-sans-serif, system-ui, sans-serif`. Used for **all** UI chrome — sidebar, nav, buttons, metadata, settings labels, timestamps, counts.

### Reasoning — why two families

The serif/sans split is the central typographic move in the design. It maps the **content / chrome** distinction directly onto the **serif / sans** distinction, so the reader's eye learns that "the serif is the article and the sans is the app." Once that mapping is established, the chrome can recede: the user stops reading the sidebar as text and starts reading it as scaffold. Don't blur the split by setting a label in serif or a title in sans.

Source Serif 4 specifically (not Pro) is chosen because of its optical-size axis — the same font carries from 10px metadata to 36px H1 without losing weight or feeling computery at small sizes. If you can't ship Source Serif 4, use Source Serif Pro 500-weight as the closest substitute.

### Type ramp

| Role | Family | Size | Weight | Line-height | Letter-spacing |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Page H1 (Subscriptions, Settings, login hero) — desktop | Serif | 28px (38px login) | 500 | 1.08–1.1 | −0.02em |
| Article-list section title (sticky header) | Serif | 22px | 500 | 1.1 | −0.015em |
| Article H1 (reader) — desktop | Serif | 36px | 500 | 1.12 | −0.02em |
| Article H1 (reader) — mobile | Serif | 26px | 500 | 1.15 | −0.02em |
| Article dek/excerpt (reader) — desktop | Serif italic | 18px | 400 | 1.45 | 0 |
| Article dek/excerpt (reader) — mobile | Serif italic | 16px | 400 | 1.5 | 0 |
| Article body | Serif | **configurable 14–24** (default 18 web / 17 Android) | 400 | 1.65 | 0 |
| List item title — desktop | Serif | 17px (15 compact) | 500 | 1.25 | −0.01em |
| List item title — mobile | Serif | 18px (16 compact) | 500 | 1.2 | −0.01em |
| Brand wordmark "Feed" | Serif | 17px (18px mobile login) | 500 | 1 | −0.01em |
| Mobile screen H1 (large title in screen header) | Serif | 30px | 500 | 1.05 | −0.02em |
| Settings row label — desktop | Sans | 14px | 500 | 1.4 | 0 |
| Settings row hint — desktop | Sans | 12px | 400 | 1.45 | 0 |
| Feed/folder list item (sidebar) | Sans | 12.5px | 400 | 1.4 | 0 |
| Primary nav item (sidebar) | Sans | 13px | 500 | 1.4 | 0 |
| Article-list excerpt | Sans | 12px web (12.5 mobile) | 400 | 1.4–1.45 | 0 |
| Reader meta line (eyebrow) | Sans | 11.5px web / 10.5px mobile | 400 | 1 | 0.06–0.08em uppercase |
| Settings section eyebrow | Sans | 11px web / 10px mobile | 500 | 1 | 0.1em uppercase, `ink3` |
| Folder name in sidebar | Sans | 10px | 500 | 1 | 0.1em uppercase, `ink3` |
| Time / min-read / counts | Sans | 10.5–12px | 400 | 1 | 0, **tabular-nums** |
| Tab-bar label (mobile) | Sans | 10px | 500 / 600 active | 1 | 0 |

### Important type details

- **`text-wrap: pretty`** is applied to the article body and to the longer hint paragraphs in the "Notes" card. This is non-negotiable for the reader — without it, the reader column produces orphans that immediately wreck the "reading a book" feel. The Android equivalent is `LineBreak.Paragraph` on the `Text` composable, or `androidx.compose.foundation.text.BasicText` with `lineBreak = LineBreak.Paragraph`.
- **`font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`** on all counts, timestamps, and min-read labels. This keeps the unread counts in the sidebar from shifting horizontally as they tick. In Compose: `TextStyle(fontFeatureSettings = "tnum")`.
- **Negative letter-spacing on serif headlines** (−0.01 to −0.02em). Default serif tracking at large sizes looks airy; tightening pulls the headline together. Negative `letterSpacing` in Compose is in `.sp` (e.g. `(-0.72).sp` for a 36sp headline at −0.02em).
- **Italic** is used in exactly three places: the article dek (subtitle under the H1 in the reader), the empty-list/empty-state copy ("Nothing here yet."), and the login subtitle paragraph. It is not used for emphasis in the body — that's a content-level choice in the source HTML, not a design-system rule.

---

## Spacing

There is **no strict modular scale.** Values are picked from `{2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 60, 80}` (px on web, dp on Android) as the design called for. When implementing in a system with a token scale (4dp or 8dp base), round to the nearest scale step — except inside the reader, where the story board's exact values must be preserved because they were tuned against the body line-height.

### Container max-widths

| Container | Max-width |
|---|---|
| Reader body column (desktop) | **900px** |
| Reader body column (mobile / Android) | full bleed minus 24dp horizontal gutter |
| Subscriptions page content (desktop) | 720px |
| Settings page content (desktop) | 640px |
| Login form (desktop) | 420px |

The 900px reader column is centred in the reader pane with `52px 48px 80px` padding, so the text line is ~804px — about a **100-character measure** at 18px body / 1.65 line-height. This is wider than the classic 45–75 target, chosen deliberately: the reader pane (`flex: 1`) grows with the viewport, and at the original 620px cap that left more than half the pane as empty margin on a maximised 1920px window (~40% text fill). At 900px the column fills ~61% of a 1920px pane while still capping line length so it never stretches unbounded on ultrawide displays. The cap engages only once the pane exceeds 900px (viewport ≳ 1500px); below that the column is pane-limited and the measure shortens (≈91 chars at 1440px, ≈72 at 1280px). **Don't widen it past 900px** — the cap is what stops the line growing without bound. If the user wants a different measure, change this number or the body font size, not the pane chrome.

---

## Radii

The design uses **very subtle rounding** — 2–4px corners across almost the entire system, with one named exception.

| Use | Radius |
|---|---|
| Cards, buttons, inputs, popovers, segmented controls | 4px |
| Avatar tile (subscription row) | 4px |
| Thumbnail placeholders | 2px |
| Feed-colour dots, unread dots | 50% (circle) |
| Brand-mark outer ring | 50% (circle) |
| Mobile tab-bar active-tab pill (around the glyph) | 999px (full pill) |

### Reasoning

Modern UI defaults to 8–16px radius (Material 3, iOS 14+). Feed uses 4px because the design is referencing **printed forms and library cards**, not app surfaces. The mobile tab bar's active pill is the only place where the design admits a fully-rounded shape, and it's there specifically to read as a soft "you are here" mark rather than as a button — the glyph is what's tappable, the pill is just its highlight.

---

## Shadows & elevation

**No drop shadows on layout chrome.** Anywhere. The design uses 1px hairlines on the `border` token to separate surfaces.

Two specific exceptions, both popovers:

1. The desktop **font-size picker** (the `Aa` popover in the reader): `0 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,.08)`, on a `panel` background with a `borderStrong` outline.
2. The desktop **subscription overflow menu** (Rename / Delete): `0 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,.10)`, on a `panel` background with a `borderStrong` outline.

These are popovers, not "lifted cards," and the shadow is there only so the popover doesn't bleed into the list under it. **Do not extend this pattern to other surfaces.** If you find yourself wanting a shadow somewhere else, you're solving a wrong problem — increase the contrast on the divider or move the surface to `panel` instead.

The **mobile bottom tab bar** uses `backdrop-filter: blur(24px)` over a `panel`-at-94%-opacity background. This is the only visually critical effect in the entire design (see **The mobile tab bar** below).

---

## Iconography

The story board uses **unicode glyphs as placeholders.** These need to be replaced with a real icon set in production (Lucide, Heroicons, Phosphor, Material Symbols Outlined — choice is the developer's). Match weight to **1.5px outlined**; don't use filled icons. The unread dot stays as-is; it is not an icon.

| Use | Prototype glyph | Production icon |
|---|---|---|
| Menu / hamburger | `≡` | menu |
| Search | `⌕` | search |
| Refresh (sidebar footer) | `↻` | refresh / arrow-clockwise |
| Share | `⎙` | share |
| Open externally | `↗` | external-link / arrow-up-right |
| Mark read (the `✓` button next to the unread dot on each row) | `✓` | check |
| Mark unread (the `↩` button in the reader action group) | `↩` | undo / corner-down-left |
| Font size picker trigger | `Aa` | (keep as text — this is a label, not an icon) |
| Reader back chevron (mobile) | `‹` | chevron-left |
| Overflow (subscription row) | `⋯` | more-horizontal |
| Mobile-tab: Unread | `◉` | circle-dot / filled-circle |
| Mobile-tab: All | `☰` | list / lines |
| Mobile-tab: Feeds | `⌒` | rss |
| Mobile-tab: Settings | `◌` | settings / sliders |
| Sign-in button trailing arrow | `→` | arrow-right |
| Sidebar brand mark | 22×22 ringed circle with 6px `accent` dot in centre | (keep — this is a design element, not an icon) |
| Unread row indicator | 6×6 dot in `accent` | (keep — this is a design element, not an icon) |

The unread dot and the brand mark are real design elements, not placeholder icons. Keep them.

**What is explicitly NOT in the icon set** (per FEATURES.md): the star / favorite glyph. Starring is dropped. Don't add a star icon back in any production iconography pass.

---

## Per-feed hue system

Each feed carries a single integer `hue` (0–360). That hue drives three things and nothing else:

1. The **6×6 dot** in the sidebar feed list and in article meta lines: `background: oklch(0.65 0.12 <hue>)`.
2. The **avatar tile** in subscription rows (36×36 desktop / 34×34 mobile): background `oklch(0.85 0.05 <hue>)`, letter `oklch(0.35 0.08 <hue>)`, serif 16/500 (15/500 mobile).
3. The **placeholder thumbnail** in card view (64×64 desktop / 56×56 mobile): 135° diagonal stripes alternating `oklch(0.90 0.03 <hue>)` and `oklch(0.85 0.04 <hue>)`, 6px stripe width, 2px radius, 1px `border` outline.

Hue assignments used by the story board seed data (`data.jsx`):

| Feed | Hue |
|---|---|
| Field Notes | 22 |
| The Loop | 215 |
| Cold Take | 0 |
| Atlas | 152 |
| The Garden | 88 |
| Frequencies | 285 |
| The Plot | 38 |

### Reasoning

The hue system gives each feed a subtle identity without committing to logos, favicons, or brand colour. It scales: a user with 50 feeds gets 50 distinct hues that all sit at the same lightness and chroma, so no feed visually shouts over another. **Don't let hue drift across surfaces.** All three uses (dot, avatar, thumbnail) must use the OKLCH formulas above; pulling hue into hex defeats the whole system because hex doesn't preserve perceptual lightness across hues.

**Persist `hue` per feed.** Default deterministically from feed id (e.g. `Math.abs(hashCode(feedId)) % 360`) so feeds get stable colours before any server-side or user customization, and so the same feed renders the same hue across reloads on web and across the web/Android clients pointing at the same server. FEED-5 in FEATURES.md depends on hue stability — see ticket #36 in the spec for the collision-tracking work.

On Android, Compose has no native OKLCH — compute the three colours in Kotlin once per feed at load:

```kotlin
fun feedDot(hue: Float)       = oklchToArgb(0.65f, 0.12f, hue)
fun feedAvatarBg(hue: Float)  = oklchToArgb(0.85f, 0.05f, hue)
fun feedAvatarInk(hue: Float) = oklchToArgb(0.35f, 0.08f, hue)
fun feedStripeA(hue: Float)   = oklchToArgb(0.90f, 0.03f, hue)
fun feedStripeB(hue: Float)   = oklchToArgb(0.85f, 0.04f, hue)
```

Memoize: compute each feed's colours once when its hue is first seen, then cache by hue. Use any OKLCH-to-ARGB routine that round-trips the Display-P3 → sRGB clamp the same way the browser does.

---

## Layout

### Desktop layout (≥1100px wide)

Three-column grid, columns scrolling independently:

```
┌───────────┬───────────────┬───────────────────────────┐
│           │               │                           │
│  Sidebar  │  Article list │   Reader pane             │
│  220px    │  400px        │   fills, content 900px    │
│           │               │   centred                 │
└───────────┴───────────────┴───────────────────────────┘
```

The reader pane's content is centred within the column at max-width 900px; the column itself fills the remaining width to accommodate wide viewports without stretching the reading measure.

On **Subscriptions** and **Settings**, the article-list + reader columns collapse into a single content area at max-width 720px and 640px respectively. The sidebar is unchanged. The page-screen route (`feed/:id`, `unread`, `all`) shows three columns; `subscriptions` and `settings` show two (sidebar + content).

Below 1100px, the desktop layout is not designed — the design assumes the responsive break to mobile happens here, not a tablet-specific layout. (If the codebase needs a tablet breakpoint, the desktop layout simply downsizes until it can't fit, then jumps to mobile.)

### Mobile layout (Android)

```
┌──────────────────────┐
│  OS status bar       │  ← top inset (~14dp on Android)
├──────────────────────┤
│  Large title header  │  ← serif H1 + small subtitle (no top icons)
├──────────────────────┤
│  Article list        │
│  (scrolls)           │
├──────────────────────┤
│  Tab bar             │  ← absolutely positioned, full-bleed,
│                      │     panel @ 94% + backdrop-filter blur,
│                      │     30dp bottom inset
└──────────────────────┘
```

Tapping an article row pushes a full-screen reader; the tab bar **hides** while the reader is open. The reader's own top bar gets a back chevron (`‹ {feedName}`) in `accent` that pops back to the list at its previous scroll position (READ-1c).

The Android header **does not have any top icons** — no hamburger, no search affordance. The tab bar IS the primary nav (per FEATURES.md — the mobile filter chips are dropped). Search lives inside the Feeds screen on its own content row.

---

## Screens

For each screen, the spec describes structure top-to-bottom and gives the values that produce the story board's look. **When in doubt, open `story-board/index.html` and inspect.**

### Web · Sidebar (shared across all logged-in screens)

220px wide, `panel` background, 1px right border in `border`, full viewport height. `IBM Plex Sans`, `ink` text. Top to bottom:

1. **Brand mark** — 20/18 padding-top, 18px horizontal. A 22×22 circle outlined 1.5px in `ink`, containing a 6×6 dot in `accent`, followed by the wordmark "**Feed**" (serif 17/500, −0.01em). 10px gap between mark and wordmark.
2. **Primary nav** — 4/10 padding, 1px gap between items. Each item is a button: 6/10 padding, 4px radius. Label left, count right (sans 11px `muted`, tabular-nums). Active state: `accentSoft` background, `accent` text. Items, in this exact order:
   - **Unread** — count = unread articles across all feeds
   - **All articles** — count = total articles
   - **Subscriptions** — count = number of feeds
   - **Settings** — no count
3. **Divider** — 1px `border`, 14/18 vertical margin.
4. **Folder list** — 10px horizontal padding, scrollable. Per folder: header (sans 10/500 0.1em uppercase `ink3`, padding 4/10). Per feed row: 5/10 padding, 4px radius, sans 12.5px. Contents: 6×6 hue dot at left, feed name (truncate with ellipsis), unread count right-aligned (sans 10.5px `muted`, tabular-nums; hidden when 0). Active feed: `accentSoft` background, `accent` text. Folder names come from the server's category field; the design's "Craft / Tech / Reading" folders are seed data, not built-in.
5. **Footer** — 12/18 padding, 1px top border in `border`. Sans 11px.
   - **Normal state:** `Synced 2m ago` (`ink3`) on the left, refresh glyph `↻` (`ink3`, button) on the right.
   - **Sync-failed state (ERR-1):** `Last sync failed · retry` (`ink2` body, `retry` link in `accent` with 1px underline, 2px underline offset), and a `!` indicator on the right in `accent`. Clicking `retry` fires a fresh sync.

### Web · Article list (400px, on Unread / All / per-feed routes)

400px wide, `bg` background, 1px right border in `border`. Independent vertical scroll. The column is fixed-width (it does not flex with the viewport); the extra width over the original 380px buys roughly one more word per line, which drops many feed titles from three rendered lines to two.

- **Sticky header** — 22/22 padding-top + horizontal, 14px padding-bottom, `bg` background, 1px bottom border in `border`. Two lines:
  - Title (serif 22/500, −0.015em). Swaps to feed name when a feed is selected, "Unread" / "All articles" otherwise.
  - Subtitle (sans 12px `ink3`): article counts, e.g. `7 unread articles` or `7 articles · M. Quinn` (author shown for per-feed views).
- **List rows** — full-row click target. Density-driven padding: compact `10/18`, regular `14/20`, comfy `20/22`. 1px bottom border in `border` between rows; the last row has none. Selected-row background: `panel`. Vertical flex, 6px gap between children.
- **Row meta line** — sans 11px `ink3`: hue dot · feed name (sans 500 `ink2`) · `·` · time-ago. Right-aligned: a **52px-wide cluster** reserved for the unread state, which always slots in the same horizontal position so titles don't shift between read and unread rows. The cluster contains, when the article is unread:
  - the 6×6 `accent` unread dot, and
  - a **22×22 mark-read button** (`✓` glyph): 1px `border`, transparent background; on hover, border becomes `borderStrong`, background becomes `panel`, glyph colour shifts from `ink3` to `ink2`. The button stops event propagation so clicking it does not select the row.
- **Title** — serif `ink`, 500, −0.01em. 17px regular/comfy, 15px compact.
- **Excerpt** — sans 12px `ink2` line-height 1.4, clamped to 2 lines via `-webkit-line-clamp: 2`. **Hidden in compact density.**
- **Thumbnail** — 64×64 striped placeholder (per-feed hue). Visible **only** when `viewMode === 'card'` OR `density === 'comfy'`. Sits to the left of the excerpt with 12px gap, both items aligned to their tops.
- **Min-read line** — sans 10.5px `ink3`, tabular-nums: `8 min read`.
- **Selected row indicator** — a 2px-wide vertical `accent` bar pinned to the **left edge** of the row (drawn at `position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; bottom: 0;` inside the row's bounding box). The row's background is `panel`. There is no other styling difference for selection.

#### Empty state

When the list has zero articles (initial fixture is empty, the current filter has no matches): centred serif italic 16px `ink3` reading "Nothing here yet.", 80px vertical padding from the sticky header. This is the same string used everywhere an empty-list state appears (ERR-2).

### Web · Reader pane

Fills the remaining viewport width. `bg` background. Independent vertical scroll. Content max-width 900px, centred, padding `52px 48px 80px`.

- **Empty state** (no article selected) — centred vertically + horizontally, `ink3` serif italic 16px, with a 32px em-dash above the text in `ink2`. Copy: "Select an article to begin reading." (READ-6).
- **Article view**, top to bottom:
  - **Meta row** — sans 11.5px uppercase 0.06em letter-spacing `ink3`: hue dot + feed name (`ink2`) + `·` + author. Right-aligned (no uppercase, no tracking, `ink3`): `2h ago · 11 min read`. 24px below this row.
  - **H1** — serif 36/500 1.12 −0.02em `ink`. 14px below.
  - **Dek** — serif italic 18/1.45 `ink2`. 32px below.
  - **Action row** — left-aligned cluster: `↗ Open` (a real `<a>` to the article URL, target `_blank`, `rel="noopener noreferrer"`), `⎙ Share`, `↩ Mark unread` / `Mark read` (label swaps with the article's read state, per READ-7). Right-aligned: `Aa` font-size trigger. Each button: 6/12 padding, 4px radius, 1px `border`, `panel` background, sans 12px `ink2`. 8px gap. 36px below.
  - **Body** — serif user-size (default 18px), line-height 1.65, paragraph-spacing 1.1em, `text-wrap: pretty`.
  - **Footer** — 44px below body, 24px top padding, 1px top border in `border`. Sans 12px `ink3`: "End of article" left, the article's link as a real `<a>` right (`ink3`, 1px underline, 2px underline offset, max-width 70%, ellipsis-truncated).

#### Font-size picker

Anchored under the `Aa` button (right: 0, top: 38). `panel` background, 1px `borderStrong` outline, 4px (read 6px) radius, 8px padding, 4px gap between items, `0 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,.08)` shadow. Six options as 30×30 cells (4px radius): 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24. Active value cell: `ink` background, `panel` foreground. Inactive: transparent, `ink2`. Sans 12px tabular-nums. Picking a value sets the global preference and closes the popover immediately (SET-3).

### Web · Subscriptions

Sidebar unchanged. Middle + right columns collapse into a single content area at **max-width 720px**, centred. `bg` background, 48/40/60 padding.

- **Header row** — 28px below itself. Serif H1 28/500 "Subscriptions" left. **`+ Add feed`** button right: 8/14 padding, 4px radius, solid `accent` background, `onAccent` text, no border, sans 12px. When open, the button toggles to "Cancel" with `panel` background, `ink2` text, and a `border` outline.
- **Add-feed form (collapsible)** — appears between the header row and the search bar when active. 12/14 padding, 1px `borderStrong`, 4px radius, `panel` background, 16px gap below. Contains: a transparent input (sans 13px `ink`, placeholder `https://example.com/feed.xml`) and a **Subscribe** submit button — 6/12 padding, `ink` background, `panel` text, no border.
- **Search bar** — 10/14 padding, 1px `border`, 4px radius, `panel` background, 24px below. 8px gap between elements: search glyph `⌕` in `ink3`, input (sans 13px `ink`, placeholder "Search subscriptions…"), right-aligned count `4 of 7` (sans 11px `ink3`). Filter is client-side (SUBS-3).
- **Feed rows** — vertical stack, 14px top/bottom padding per row, 1px bottom `border` between (none on the last row), 14px gap between row elements:
  - **Avatar** — 36×36, 4px radius, hue-tinted background, letter in deeper hue, serif 16/500. Letter is `name[0]`.
  - **Body block** (flex: 1, min-width: 0):
    - Name (serif 16/500). In rename mode, swap to an `<input>` with 1px `borderStrong` bottom border, no fill, prepopulated and **pre-selected** (`el.select()` after focus — SUBS-4).
    - URL (sans 11.5px `ink3`), 2px below name.
  - **Folder cell** — 74px wide, right-aligned, sans 11px `ink3`. Shows the folder name.
  - **Unread cell** — 60px wide, right-aligned, sans 11px `ink3` tabular-nums. Shows `N new`.
  - **Overflow button** `⋯` — 4/8 padding, transparent, `ink3`. Opens the menu below.

#### Subscription overflow menu

Anchored to the `⋯` button (right: 0, top: 28). `panel` background, 1px `borderStrong` outline, 4px radius, `0 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,.10)` shadow, min-width 140px, 4px inner padding. Two items, each: full-width button, 7/12 padding, 3px radius, sans 13px `ink`, transparent background:
- **Rename…** — `ink` text. Opens the inline rename input (see above).
- **Delete** — `danger` text. Confirms via `confirm()` dialog, then removes the row (SUBS-5).

The menu **must render above adjacent rows**, not be clipped by the row's bounding box. In CSS this means `position: absolute; z-index: 50` on the menu, with a `position: fixed; inset: 0; z-index: 40` click-away catcher behind it.

#### Empty state

If the search filter has no matches: centred serif italic 16px `ink3` "Nothing here yet.", 60px vertical padding.

### Web · Settings

Sidebar unchanged. Content area **max-width 640px**, centred. `bg` background, 48/40/60 padding.

- **H1** — "Settings", serif 28/500. 28px below.
- **Section labels** — sans 11px 500 0.1em uppercase `ink3`. Section labels render with 32px top margin and 4px bottom margin. Sections, in order: **Reading**, **Sync**, **Account**.
- **Rows** — 18px top/bottom padding, 1px `border` between, 24px gap between label-block and control:
  - Left: label (sans 14/500 `ink`), max-width 360px, optional hint below (sans 12px line-height 1.45 `ink3`).
  - Right: a control. For all preference rows the control is a **segmented control** (see below). For one-shot rows (Import OPML, Logout) the control is a single button.

#### Segmented control

A row of 1px-`border` outlined cells, 4px radius, `panel` background, no inter-cell border. Each cell: 6/12 padding, sans 12px, tabular-nums, button reset. Active cell: `ink` background, `panel` text. Inactive cell: transparent, `ink2` text.

#### Rows shown (web)

Order matters here; this is the canonical web Settings surface:

| Section | Label | Hint | Control |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reading | Reader font size | "Applies to the article body. Live-updates the open reader without reload." | Segmented: 14 / 16 / 18 / 20 / 22 / 24 |
| Reading | Article-list density | "Compact hides excerpts; Comfy shows thumbnails." | Segmented: Compact / Regular / Comfy |
| Sync | Refresh interval | "Client-side auto-poll cadence for the article list." | Segmented: 15m / 1h / 6h / Manual |
| Sync | Keep articles | "Retention window. ∞ disables retention." | Segmented: 30d / 90d / 1y / ∞ |
| Account | Import OPML | "Bring in a backup or export from another reader." | Button: "Choose file…" (same styling as reader action buttons) |
| Account | About | "Client v1.0.0 · Server v0.7.2" | Em-dash placeholder `—` in `ink3` |
| Account | Logout | "Clears the local session and returns to the login screen." | Button: "Sign out" — same shape as the action buttons but with `danger`-coloured text and `danger`-coloured border |

The web Settings surface has **no Server URL row** (FEATURES.md ticket #32).

### Web · Login

Centred form on a full-bleed `bg` page. Form width 420px, vertical flex with 32px gap between the wordmark and the form block; 26px gap within the form block.

- **Wordmark** — the 22×22 outlined-circle mark + serif 22/500 "Feed" (this version omits the inner accent dot; it's a smaller serif "F" rendered inside the ring at 60% of the ring size, italic).
- **Eyebrow** — sans 11px 0.18em uppercase `ink3`, "Sign in", 14px above the H1.
- **H1** — serif 38/500 1.08 −0.02em `ink`, `text-wrap: balance`. Copy: "Welcome back to your reading room."
- **Subtitle** — serif italic 15/1.5 `ink2`, 12px below H1, `text-wrap: pretty`. Copy: two sentences about quiet feeds and no algorithm.
- **Form fields** — 22px gap between fields. Each field is a `<label>` with:
  - **Field label** — sans 11px 0.14em uppercase `ink3`, 6px above the input.
  - **Input row** — a flex row with `borderBottom: 1px solid borderStrong`, 8px bottom padding. Input has no chrome (`border: none; outline: none; background: transparent`), sans 16px `ink`. The Password field has a trailing **Show** button (transparent, no border, sans 12px 0.06em `ink3`).
- **Auth error** (visible only when credentials are invalid — AUTH-2) — between the password field and the primary button. Sans 13px `danger` on `accentSoft` background, 1px `danger` border, 10/14 padding, with a leading serif italic `!`. Copy: "Invalid username or password." Focus stays on the password field.
- **Primary button** — full-width, `ink` background, `panel` text, 14/22 padding, sans 14/500 0.02em, no border. Trailing serif 18px `→` arrow.

Username + password is the only auth path FEATURES.md cares about, so the screen carries **only** what that path needs: wordmark, hero, the two fields, the auth error, and the Sign-in button. There is **no** `or` divider, third-party / magic-link / account-creation affordance, "Forgot password?", "Keep me signed in", or footer line. (Earlier drafts showed those as decoration; they were removed.)

### Mobile (Android) · Article list — Unread / All

Vertical flex, full-bleed `bg`. Top to bottom:

- **Screen header** — 22px horizontal padding, top-inset + 14px padding-top, 18px padding-bottom, `bg` background, 1px bottom `border`. Contains:
  - **Large title** — serif 30/500 −0.02em line-height 1.05. "Unread" or "All".
  - **Subtitle** — sans 12px `ink3`, 6px below title. Format: `7 articles` (Unread) or `7 unread · 24 total` (All).
- **Article rows** — full width, density-driven padding: compact 12/22, regular 16/22, comfy 20/22. 1px bottom `border` between rows. Vertical flex with 8px gap.
  - **Meta line** — same shape as desktop: hue dot · feed name (sans 500 `ink2`) · `·` · time-ago, in sans 11px `ink3`. Right-aligned 52px-wide cluster: 6×6 unread dot + 28×28 mark-read button (`✓`), same role as the desktop button but sized for touch — 28×28 hit target, 1px `border`, `panel` background, `ink3` glyph at sans 12px.
  - **Title** — serif `ink`, 500, −0.01em. 18px regular/comfy, 16px compact.
  - **Excerpt** — sans 12.5px `ink2` line-height 1.45, 2-line clamp. Hidden in compact density.
  - **Thumbnail** — 56×56 striped placeholder, only in card or comfy mode.
  - **Min-read line** — sans 10.5px `ink3` tabular-nums.
- **Pull-to-refresh indicator** — a centred row above the list, only visible while loading. Sans 11px `ink3` "Refreshing…" preceded by a 14×14 spinner: 2px `border` ring with the top quadrant in `accent`, rotating 360° on an `.8s linear infinite` keyframe. (This is the one motion exception in the design — see Animation.)

### Mobile (Android) · Reader

Vertical flex on `bg`. Top to bottom:

- **Top bar** — top-inset + 10px padding-top, 16px horizontal, 10px padding-bottom, `bg` background, 1px bottom `border`.
  - **Back chevron** — `‹ {feedName}` in sans 14px `accent`, 4/6 padding. Pops back to the list at its previous scroll position (READ-1c).
  - **Right cluster** — 4px gap: three small buttons. **`↩` Mark unread** (only when the article is read), **`Aa`** (font-size popover), **`↗`** (real `<a>` to `article.link`, target `_blank`). Each: 6/10 padding, 4px radius, 1px `border`, `panel` background, sans 12px `ink2`.
- **Font-size popover** — anchored top: 56, right: 16; otherwise identical to the desktop picker (see Reader / Font-size picker above), at 6px padding gap.
- **Body** — 24/24/80 padding, scrollable.
  - **Meta eyebrow** — sans 10.5px 0.08em uppercase `ink3`: `Field Notes · M. Quinn · 2h`.
  - **H1** — serif 26/500 1.15 −0.02em `ink`. 12px below.
  - **Dek** — serif italic 16/1.5 `ink2`. 22px below.
  - **Body** — serif user-size (default 17px on mobile = web font size minus 1, clamped at 15), line-height 1.65, paragraphs 1.1em apart, `text-wrap: pretty`.
  - **Footer** — 28px below body, 18px top padding, 1px top `border`. Sans 11px `ink3`: "End of article" left, the article link right (`ink3`, 1px underline, max-width 60%, ellipsis).

### Mobile (Android) · Feeds (Subscriptions)

Vertical flex.

- **Screen header** — same shape as the list header. Title "Feeds", subtitle "`N` subscriptions".
- **Search row** — 14/22 padding-top + horizontal: a single search box: 10/14 padding, 1px `border`, 4px radius, `panel` background. Glyph `⌕` in `ink3`, then the input (sans 13px `ink`, placeholder "Search or paste a URL…"). 8px gap.
- **Folder groups** — per folder:
  - **Folder header** — 14/22 padding-top, 6px padding-bottom, sans 10/500 0.1em uppercase `ink3`. This is the canonical "uppercase folder header" — Android groups subscriptions by folder, web lists them flat with the folder name in the right column (SUBS-1).
  - **Feed rows** — 12/22 padding, 1px bottom `border`, `bg` background, 14px gap between elements:
    - Avatar — 34×34, 4px radius, hue-tinted, serif 15/500 letter.
    - Body — name (serif 15/500 `ink`), URL (sans 11px `ink3`, ellipsis, 2px below).
    - Right — unread count (sans 11px `ink3` tabular-nums).

The mobile Feeds screen has no `+ Add feed` button in the story board; the search bar copy implies "or paste a URL" as the affordance. Production may add a FAB or header `+` button if needed — that's an implementation decision, not a spec change.

### Mobile (Android) · Settings

Vertical flex.

- **Screen header** — title "Settings", subtitle "Signed in as admin" (or whatever the username is).
- **Groups** — same uppercase header pattern as Feeds. In order: **Reading**, **Sync**, **Account**.
- **Rows** — full-width button, 12/22 padding, 1px bottom `border` (none on the last in a group), `bg` background, flex row:
  - Left block — label (sans 14px `ink`, or `accent` if the row is destructive), with an optional hint below (sans 11.5px `ink3`, ellipsis-truncated to one line).
  - Right block — a control (for segmented prefs) **or** a chevron-like indicator (`›` in `ink3` for routing rows, or "Choose…" for the OPML row).

#### Rows shown (Android)

| Section | Label | Hint | Right |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reading | Reader font size | "Applies to article body — live." | Segmented 14 / 16 / 18 / 20 / 22 / 24 |
| Reading | Article-list density | "Compact hides excerpts. Comfy shows thumbnails." | Segmented Compact / Regular / Comfy |
| Sync | Refresh interval | "Client-side auto-poll cadence." | Segmented 15m / 1h / 6h / Manual |
| Sync | Keep articles | "Retention window for the server sweep." | Segmented 30d / 90d / 1y / ∞ |
| Sync | **Server URL** | the current server URL | `›` (routes to an editor) |
| Account | Import OPML | "Upload a backup or another reader's export." | `Choose…` in `ink2` |
| Account | About | "Client v1.0.0 · Server v0.7.2" | `›` |
| Account | Logout | (no hint) | `›` in `accent` (destructive row — label is in `accent`) |

The Android surface has the **Server URL** row; the web surface does not. This asymmetry is intentional (FEATURES.md, Settings reference).

### Mobile (Android) · Login

Vertical flex on `panel` (not `bg` — the login page sits on the "card" background to feel slightly distinct from the main app). 22px horizontal padding throughout, top-inset honoured.

- **Top bar** — 14/22 padding. Left: the wordmark at 18px. (No "Sign up" link — there is no account-creation path.)
- **Hero** — 24/22 padding-top, 8px padding-bottom.
  - **Eyebrow** — sans 10/500 0.18em uppercase `ink3`, "Sign in". 10px below.
  - **H1** — serif 30/500 1.1 −0.02em `ink`, `text-wrap: balance`. "Welcome back to your reading room."
  - **Subtitle** — serif italic 14/1.45 `ink2`, 10px below H1, `text-wrap: pretty`. One sentence.
- **Form** — 20/22 padding-top, 20px gap. Fields are the same shape as web. The password field's `enterKeyHint="go"` and the username field's `enterKeyHint="next"` configure the Android IME action labels (AUTH-1b).
- **Auth error** — `compact` variant of the same component: sans 12px `danger` on `accentSoft` with 1px `danger` border, 8/12 padding.
- **Primary button** — same shape as web. (No secondary row, divider, ghost buttons, or footer — same as web, username + password is the only auth path.)

### Mobile (Android) · Tab bar

The defining piece of mobile chrome.

- **Position** — `position: absolute; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0;`. 30px padding-bottom (gesture clearance), 6px padding-top, 1px top `border`. `zIndex: 20` so it sits over the scrolling list.
- **Background** — `panel` at ~94% opacity (`#f9fafb` with alpha `f0` = 240/255), plus `backdrop-filter: blur(24px)` and `-webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(24px)`. This is the only visually critical effect in the entire design. **Do not flatten** the alpha background to opaque `panel`; the slightly-translucent layer on top of a blurred article-list under-layer is what makes the bar feel quiet rather than heavy.
- **Layout** — four equal flex items.
- **Per tab** — vertical flex, 3px gap. Top: a serif glyph 18px in a 4/18 pill (4px vertical, 18px horizontal padding), 999px radius. Bottom: sans 10px label.
  - **Active**: tab colour = `accent`, glyph pill background = `accentSoft`, label weight = 600.
  - **Inactive**: tab colour = `ink3`, glyph pill background = transparent, label weight = 500.
- **Tabs**, in this exact order: **Unread** (`◉`) · **All** (`☰`) · **Feeds** (`⌒`) · **Settings** (`◌`). The Reader screen hides the tab bar entirely (READ-1b).

On Android, replace `backdrop-filter` with a translucent `Modifier.background(Color(0xF0F9FAFB))` over the parent's scroll content — the platform doesn't support a true backdrop blur on the tab bar surface yet, and overlay-based fakes look worse than the flat translucent fallback. The blur is the web-only luxury.

## Density, view mode, font size

Three user-controlled visual variables, persisted globally. All three apply to article lists; font-size applies additionally to the reader body.

| Variable | Values | Default (web / Android) | Affects |
|---|---|---|---|
| `density` | `compact` / `regular` / `comfy` | `regular` | Article list row padding + whether excerpt + thumbnail show |
| `viewMode` | `list` / `card` | `list` | Whether the article list shows thumbnails (card forces them on) |
| `fontSize` | 14–24 (px web, sp Android) | 18 / 17 | Reader body font size only |

### Density behaviour

- **Compact** — tightest row padding (10/18 desktop, 12/22 mobile). **No excerpt.** **No thumbnail.** Title at smaller size (15px desktop, 16px mobile).
- **Regular** — standard padding. 2-line excerpt visible. Thumbnail visible only if `viewMode === 'card'`.
- **Comfy** — wider padding (20/22). 2-line excerpt **and** thumbnail always visible (overrides `viewMode` for thumbnail visibility).

### View-mode behaviour

- **List** — no thumbnails (unless density is comfy).
- **Card** — thumbnails always visible alongside the excerpt.

### Font-size behaviour

- The slider / picker is the same six steps everywhere: 14 / 16 / 18 / 20 / 22 / 24. (No continuous slider.)
- Web stores the value in px and applies it to the reader body's `font-size`. Android stores it in sp.
- The mobile story board reads `web fontSize - 1` (clamped at 15) so a single shared "18" renders as 18px on web and 17sp on Android. In production, use the platform's stored sp value directly rather than re-deriving from a web value.
- Changing the value while the reader is open re-renders the body in place — no reload, no scroll-position reset (SET-3).

## States & feedback

Everything that isn't the happy path. The same principle that runs through the rest of the doc — **pick the quietest surface that fits the blast radius of the failure** — applied here as a small ladder.

| Blast radius | Surface |
|---|---|
| App-wide, can degrade gracefully | **Banner** atop the content area; underlying content stays interactive |
| App-wide, blocked | **Big mid-pane state** replaces list + reader |
| One feed | Sidebar `!` badge + targeted mid-pane (or list stripe) |
| One article | **Inline reader note** above the body |
| Form input | **Inline error** anchored under the field, with what we tried |
| Session / auth | **Modal** — interrupt only when re-input is required |
| Background / sync | **Sidebar footer** state (web) or **snackbar** (Android) |

The story board renders one artboard per common scenario under the **Edge cases · …** sections of the design canvas. Open `story-board/index.html` and zoom each card to see the canonical pixel values; this section gives you the rules behind them. Each scenario also maps to an `ERR-*` row in [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md).

### Tones

Three semantic tones are derived from the palette. All sit at low chroma so they don't shout next to the cool greys.

| Tone | Background | Foreground | Border | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Info** | `accentSoft` | `accent` | `border` | Routine notices, neutral confirmations. Indistinguishable in colour from the active-nav pill — info is "the system noticed." |
| **Warn** | `oklch(0.96 0.035 78)` | `oklch(0.40 0.10 70)` | `oklch(0.86 0.06 75)` | Degraded mode, soft block, "this still works but…". |
| **Error** | `oklch(0.965 0.025 25)` | `oklch(0.42 0.13 25)` | `oklch(0.86 0.07 25)` | Hard failure. Shares the hue family with `danger` so error feedback and destructive actions live in the same colour neighbourhood. |

These are **not** added to the core palette table — they appear only inside feedback surfaces and they don't compose with each other (no warn-on-error nesting). Compute the OKLCH values once at theme-load and store as CSS custom properties / Compose colours; don't re-derive per render.

```css
--warn-bg: oklch(0.96 0.035 78);
--warn-fg: oklch(0.40 0.10 70);
--warn-bd: oklch(0.86 0.06 75);
--err-bg:  oklch(0.965 0.025 25);
--err-fg:  oklch(0.42 0.13 25);
--err-bd:  oklch(0.86 0.07 25);
```

Each surface starts with a **monospace pill** carrying the tone label — `INFO` / `WARN` / `ERR` — in `ui-monospace` 9.5–10.5px, 0.14–0.16em letter-spacing, all caps, with a 1px border in the tone colour, a 45%-opaque white fill, 2px radius, and 2/6 padding. The pill is the only visible "icon" in the system; it works the way the unread dot works for articles — recognition at a glance, no iconography library required.

### Banner

For app-wide conditions where the user can still navigate and read.

- **Position** — full-width row, top of the content area (below the column header on Subscriptions / Settings, above the article list elsewhere). Web only; Android uses a snackbar instead.
- **Padding** — 9px vertical / 18px horizontal.
- **Border** — 1px bottom in the tone's border colour. No top border (the column header above carries it). No background bleed onto the sidebar.
- **Pill** — leading, flush-left, 12px gap to the message.
- **Body** — sans 12.5px, tone foreground, line-height 1.4. Up to two sentences. Lead with the state, follow with what we'll do about it; bold the most important noun (count of cached articles, name of the feed, time remaining).
- **Action** *(optional)* — right-aligned link, same colour as the body, 1px underline, 2px underline offset.

Banners do **not** auto-dismiss; they disappear when the underlying condition does.

### Big mid-pane state

For when the right-hand area can't show useful content — server unreachable, no subscriptions, all caught up, dead feed.

- **Position** — fills the article-list + reader area (the entire content column on Subscriptions / Settings). Centred on both axes. 40px padding all sides.
- **Max width** — 460px text column.
- **Top to bottom**:
  - **Eyebrow** — `ui-monospace` 10.5px 0.14em uppercase `ink3`. 16px below itself. Carries the error code or semantic label (`ERR · CONN_REFUSED`, `WELCOME`, `INBOX ZERO`).
  - **Title** — serif 28/500 1.15 −0.02em `ink`. 12px below. One sentence, ending with a period. Personable, not technical (`Couldn't reach the server.`, not `Connection refused.`).
  - **Body** — serif italic 15.5 / line-height 1.55, `ink2`, `text-wrap: pretty`. 26px below (18px if a `mono` block follows). Two sentences max: one for what happened, one for what to do or what we'll do.
  - **Mono detail block** *(optional)* — `ui-monospace` 11 / line-height 1.55, `ink2`, on `panel` with 1px `border`, 3px radius, 10/14 padding, left-aligned, multi-line OK. Holds the technical detail: endpoint, status code, retry budget. Hidden on Android (the snackbar carries this).
  - **Action buttons** — centred inline cluster, 8px gap. **Primary** = `ink` background, `panel` text, 10/18 padding, 4px radius, sans 12.5. **Secondary** = the reader-action button shape (1px `border`, `panel` background, `ink2`, 6/12, 4px radius). Either button is optional; some states are dead-ends with no useful action.
  - **Hint** *(optional)* — sans 11.5px `ink3`, 22px below the buttons. One sentence of supporting context.

The four happy-path "empty" states — *Select an article*, *Nothing here yet*, *Caught up*, *First run* — share this surface family. The serif-italic body line is the through-line that ties them to the design's voice rather than to a generic empty-state pattern. **Reuse this component**; don't fork a separate "error screen" component for hard failures.

### Inline form error

For input-level failures (bad URL in Add Feed, invalid credentials at login).

- **Anchored** — inside the form group, directly below the field, 8px below the input row.
- **Layout** — flex row, 8px gap. Leading tone pill (`ERR` or `WARN`) at 9.5px / 0.14em. Message inline, no surrounding border, no fill.
- **Message** — sans 12px, tone foreground, line-height 1.45. Name what we tried (`/feed`, `/rss`, `/atom.xml` …) and what to do next ("paste the feed URL directly", "open it instead"). Don't truncate at "Invalid URL"; an unrecovered user is the failure.
- **Field state** — the input row's border switches to the tone border colour while the error is present.

The login auth-error component (specified in §Web · Login) is a `compact` variant of this — bordered box rather than inline because it carries more weight and persists after the user retypes.

### Modal interrupt

For session-level events where input is required to continue (session expired, account credential re-auth).

- **Overlay** — `rgba(20, 25, 40, 0.32)` scrim with a 2px backdrop blur over the entire viewport. Click-through is blocked.
- **Dialog** — 420px wide, `bg` background (not `panel` — modals sit on the same "paper" as the content), 1px `borderStrong` outline, `0 24px 60px rgba(0, 0, 0, .18)` shadow, 32/32/28 padding, left-aligned content.
- **Eyebrow** — same as the big mid-pane state, but in the tone foreground (warn for session interrupts).
- **Title / body** — serif 24/500 + serif italic 14.5; smaller than the big mid-pane variant because the modal is the foreground and doesn't need to fill space.
- **Optional inner detail strip** — a `panel` strip showing the identity / context the user needs to verify (e.g. `Signed in as admin@feed.app`). 10/14 padding, 1px `border`, 3px radius, sans 12 with the value in `ui-monospace`.
- **Action row** — primary + secondary, left-aligned, 20px below the body.

The modal is the **only** surface that interrupts the user; treat it like a fire alarm and use it sparingly. Even an unrecoverable error goes through the big mid-pane state unless it requires the user to type something to recover.

### Raw-response inspector

A devtools-style detail view for the **feed parse error** case (ERR-8). Reached from the banner's `View raw response ↗` link on web, or the snackbar's `Details` action on Android. Lives inside the editorial shell — on web the sidebar stays visible so the user keeps app context; on Android it's a full-screen pushed view with the tab bar hidden, same shape as the reader.

Four stacked regions, top to bottom:

1. **Top bar** — sans 13px. Back link to the feed (`‹ {feedName}` in `accent`), separator dot, `Raw response` label in `ink`. Right-aligned: `Copy` button + `↗ Open URL` link, both in the reader-action button shape.
2. **Metadata strip** — `panel` background, 1px bottom `border`. Two-column grid: `auto 1fr` with 22px column gap, 8px row gap, 14/22 padding. Each row is an uppercase eyebrow label (sans 10/500 0.14em `ink3`) on the left and a value on the right (sans 12.5 `ink2`, with technical values in `ui-monospace` `ink`). Required rows:
   - `URL` — the full request URL in monospace.
   - `Fetched` — relative time + absolute UTC timestamp + retry counter (`attempt 4 of 5`).
   - `Response` — status, byte size, Content-Type. When the Content-Type is the cause of the failure (e.g. `text/html` instead of `application/rss+xml`), tint the bad value in `err-fg`.
   - `Parser` — error message, prefixed by an inline `ERR` pill. State what we expected vs what we got, in monospace, with line/col coordinates.
3. **Source view** — `bg` background, `ui-monospace` 12.5/1.7 `ink`. Two-column subgrid per line: a 56px right-aligned gutter for line numbers (`ink3`, `tabular-nums`, `userSelect: none`) and the source line itself (`whiteSpace: pre`, no wrap). The error line gets `err-bg` background and a 2px `err-fg` border on the left edge; its line number renders in `err-fg` 600. A single caret annotation row sits directly under the error line — empty gutter, then a run of `^` characters in `err-fg` 11px followed by a one-line plain-English explanation. The view scrolls vertically; for long lines on mobile, prefer soft-wrapping at semantic boundaries rather than horizontal scroll.
4. **Footer detail strip** — `panel` background, 1px top `border`, 12/22 padding. Sans 12 `ink3` body on the left ("Cached articles still display in the feed. We'll retry every **6h**; after 14 consecutive failures the feed will be marked _Gone_."), `Retry now` link in `accent` on the right. On Android, the footer is omitted — the metadata strip already carries the recovery info and screen height is precious.

The inspector is the **only** place in the design where line-numbered source code appears. If another "inspect what came over the wire" scenario emerges later (OPML import that didn't parse, a malformed response from an OAuth callback), reuse this exact component — same line-number gutter width, same caret annotation row, same metadata-strip rows. **Don't fork a second source-viewer**; consistency here is how the user learns that "if a screen looks like this, it's the literal bytes from the server."

### Inline reader note

For when one specific article needs metadata appended to its reading experience (the cached version is stale, the source URL is 404'd, the feed has been removed).

- **Position** — between the action row and the body in the reader, **inside** the 900px reading column so it scrolls with the article.
- **Shape** — banner-like: same tone background and border, 12/14 padding, flex row with the tone pill leading. 28px bottom margin so it doesn't fuse with the body.
- **Typography** — sans 12.5px, tone foreground, line-height 1.5. Single sentence. `<code>` runs for URLs use `ui-monospace`.

Note vs. banner: the note is **inside** the reading column; the banner pattern wraps **outside** it. A top-of-page banner says "the app is in this state", an inline note says "this article is in this state."

### Sidebar per-feed badge

For when one specific feed has stopped working.

- **`!` chip** — appears immediately after the feed name in the sidebar row. `ui-monospace` 10px 600 in error foreground, 1px error border, 2px radius, error background fill, 0/4 padding. Sits in the same line as the name, before any unread count.
- **Dead-feed treatment** — the feed name renders with `line-through` and the row drops to 0.55 opacity. The unread count is hidden (a dead feed has no new unread). Tapping the row navigates to the relevant big mid-pane state (Feed Gone, etc).
- **Per-feed scope, not app-wide** — even with two feeds failing, the sidebar shows two badges, not a top-of-page banner. Aggregate failures only escalate to a banner when *every* feed is failing — and that means the server itself is down, which is the Server Unreachable big mid-pane state.

### Sidebar footer · sync states

The sidebar footer is the persistent global status indicator. It carries one of five states:

| State | Left text | Right glyph | Tone |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ok` (default) | `Synced {Nm} ago` in `ink3` | `↻` button in `ink3` | — |
| `syncing` | `Syncing…` in `ink3` | `↻` indicator in `ink3` (optionally spinning per the mobile-spinner spec) | — |
| `failed` | `Last sync failed · retry` (`ink2` body, `retry` in `accent` with 1px underline + 2px offset) | `!` in error fg | error |
| `offline` | `Offline · cache only` in `ink2` | `○` in `ink3` | warn |
| `paused` | `Paused · {duration}` in `ink2` (e.g. for rate limiting) | `‖` in warn fg | warn |

The right-side glyph is decorative; it reinforces the left text colour but is not the primary signal. **Do not introduce a sixth state** — every condition the footer needs to communicate fits one of these five.

### List-level empty state

The 80px-padded centred-italic "Nothing here yet." pattern (specified in §Web · Article list) covers:

- the Unread list when nothing is unread *(consider routing to the **Inbox zero** big mid-pane state instead, which is more rewarding)*,
- a per-feed view when that feed has no articles,
- the Subscriptions search with no matches.

When the empty state needs a verb (an action the user should take), upgrade from the centred italic to a big mid-pane state. The italic is for "this is empty and that's fine"; the big mid-pane is for "this is empty and you should do something."

### Loading

The design deliberately omits skeleton screens. Two patterns cover loading:

1. **Sidebar footer = `Syncing…`** for any background sync. Non-blocking; the rest of the app stays interactive against the cache.
2. **Mobile pull-to-refresh spinner** (see §Animation) for user-initiated refresh on Android.

For routes that genuinely cannot show anything until data arrives (cold boot from a cache miss), the big mid-pane state takes the role of skeleton, with the body line *"Loading your feeds…"* in serif italic and no buttons. This is the only place "loading" appears as a first-class state in the design. **Do not introduce shimmer skeletons** — they're a different aesthetic.

### Toasts / snackbars (Android)

Web uses banners; Android uses snackbars where ephemeral confirmation is needed (failed pull-to-refresh, OPML-import summary, "marked 12 articles read"). The story board's mobile edge-case artboards render them; this section codifies the rules behind those artboards:

- 56dp tall (single-line) or 80dp (two-line), full-width minus 16dp horizontal gutters, 16dp above the bottom-nav tab bar (or above the gesture inset if the tab bar is hidden).
- `ink` background, `panel` text, sans 14 / line-height 1.4. 4px radius. No shadow.
- One optional trailing action in `accent` text (right-aligned, sans 13 / 500).
- 4s default; 6s with an action; sticky until dismissed when the error is unrecoverable.
- One snackbar at a time; new snackbars replace the previous one.

This is the only Material-flavoured pattern in the mobile design — see the **No-Material rule** under §Palette for the carve-out reasoning.

### Catalogue

The story board's design canvas carries one artboard per scenario under the **App states** and **Edge cases** sections. Current set:

| Scenario | Surface(s) | Tone | FEATURES.md |
|---|---|---|---|
| Empty list (filter → 0 articles) | Sticky list header + centred italic | — | ERR-2 |
| Sync failed | Sidebar-footer state (web) / snackbar (Android) | error | ERR-1 |
| Syncing | Sidebar-footer state (web) / pull-to-refresh spinner (Android) | — | — |
| Auth error | Inline login-form error | error | AUTH-2 |
| Offline · cache only | Banner + sidebar footer | warn | ERR-4 |
| Server unreachable | Big mid-pane + sidebar footer | error | ERR-5 |
| Rate-limited | Banner + sidebar footer | warn | ERR-6 |
| Feed gone (410) | Sidebar badge + big mid-pane | error | ERR-7 |
| Feed parse error | Sidebar badge + banner over stale list; opens **raw-response inspector** | error | ERR-8 |
| Article link-rot | Inline reader note | warn | ERR-9 |
| First run · no feeds | Big mid-pane | info | ERR-10 |
| Inbox zero | Big mid-pane | info | ERR-11 |
| No search results | List-level empty state | — | ERR-2 (re-uses) |
| Add feed · not a feed | Inline form error | error | ERR-12 |
| Add feed · duplicate | Inline form error | warn | ERR-13 |
| Session expired | Modal | warn | ERR-14 |

Add a new row whenever a new scenario ships in the story board, and back-fill the FEATURES.md column once it has an `ERR-*` ID.

### Dedicated artboards over tweak walkthroughs

The story board previously exposed a floating **Tweaks** panel that mirrored the in-product Settings page — density, font size, refresh cadence, retention, plus a `state` selector for walking through `empty` / `sync-failed` / `auth-error` / `loading`. That entire surface has been retired.

- User-facing **preferences** (density, font size, refresh, retention) live in exactly one place: the in-product **Settings page** on each device. Editing them there updates the live story board in place.
- Non-happy-path **states** (empty filter, failed sync, in-flight refresh, login errors, and every entry in the edge-case catalogue) each have a **dedicated artboard** on the canvas. The rule: any state worth keeping a visual contract for gets its own artboard.

The trade-off the old Tweaks panel made — quick exploration at the cost of two surfaces drifting out of sync — wasn't paying off. Dedicated artboards are slower to set up but the contract is unambiguous, and a reviewer doesn't have to *do* anything to see what each state looks like. List-level empty state copy and behaviour are described in §Empty state under Web · Article list.

## Animation

The design is **almost entirely static**. There are no transitions on hover, no fade-ins on navigation, no easings on selection — clicking a row swaps the reader pane instantly. Two exceptions that are part of the spec:

1. **The mobile pull-to-refresh spinner** — a 14×14 ring rotating 360° every 0.8s, `linear` timing, infinite. Visible only while a refresh is in flight.
2. **Hover micro-feedback on the mark-read button** — border, background, and glyph colour all transition over `100ms` (`transition: border-color .1s, color .1s, background .1s`) so the cursor-on-target signal isn't jarring.

Everything else is unanimated. This is a positive design choice, not an oversight — please don't add transitions during integration.

## Copy

All product copy in the design is **final**. Notable strings:

- Brand name: **Feed**
- Empty reader pane (web): "Select an article to begin reading."
- Empty list (anywhere): "Nothing here yet." (serif italic 16px `ink3`).
- Sidebar footer normal: `Synced 2m ago` · sync-failed: `Last sync failed · retry`.
- Login eyebrow: "Sign in". Login H1: "Welcome back to your reading room." Login subtitle (web): "Your feeds, quietly waiting. No algorithm, no infinite scroll — just the few writers you chose."
- Login submit: "Sign in" (with trailing `→`).
- Auth error: "Invalid username or password."
- Subscriptions H1: "Subscriptions". Add-feed button: "+ Add feed". Add-feed submit: "Subscribe". Search placeholder (web): "Search subscriptions…" (mobile: "Search or paste a URL…").
- Settings group headers: "Reading" / "Sync" / "Account".
- Settings actions: "Choose file…" (Import OPML), "Sign out" (Logout).
- Mobile tab labels: "Unread" / "All" / "Feeds" / "Settings" (note: web nav uses "All articles", mobile uses "All").
- Reader action labels: "↗ Open" / "⎙ Share" / "↩ Mark unread" / "Mark read" (label swaps with the article's read state).

The seed feed names and article titles in `data.jsx` are placeholders — they exist only to make the layout look populated. Replace with real user data.

---

## Assets

- **No bitmap or vector assets ship with the design.** Zero images, zero logos beyond the procedural ringed circle, no decorative SVGs.
- **Two web fonts** — Source Serif 4, IBM Plex Sans. Bundle them; don't rely on Google Fonts in production.
- **Procedural thumbnail placeholders** — diagonal `oklch()` stripes keyed off per-feed hue. Replace with real OG-image fetches if a feed provides one; otherwise keep the procedural fallback. The fallback is not a stopgap — it's the canonical card-view thumbnail.

## When this spec is ambiguous

The story board at `story-board/index.html` (and its source files in `story-board/prototypes/`) is the visual source of truth. If a value in this spec disagrees with the story board, the story board wins. If a value is missing from both, default to the **quietest, most paper-like** interpretation and flag for design review. If the spec describes a UI element FEATURES.md drops (or vice versa), FEATURES.md wins — delete the visual element.
