# Feed — TODO

Backlog of tickets, organized by **execution priority** (P0 → P4). Reference tickets by their numeric ID (e.g. "work on #3"). Numeric IDs are stable; gaps from closed/superseded tickets are intentional.

Status legend: `[ ]` open · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done · `[-]` closed without action · `[?]` needs verification

Within each priority phase, tickets are grouped so a single grouping fits naturally into one Sonnet 4.6 session.

---

## P0 — Unblockers

Land these before any P1 work; everything downstream benefits.

### #27 — Android: article list is empty after login `[ ]`

After a successful login on Android, the Feed screen renders no rows even though the server has articles. This blocks every FEED-*, READ-*, MOB-*, SET-3, SET-4 and ERR-1 manual test on Android.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Logging into Android with a populated server shows the same article list the web client shows for the same account.
- Pulling/refresh works (see #33).
- A new JVM test (Robolectric + `ServerRule`) exercises the login → list-populated path and asserts non-zero rows. Likely related to the network/JSON drift class of bugs (#23 / #24); the fix should land before re-running the catalog on Android.

---

## P1 — Spec gap fixes

These close the `⚠` / `✗` rows in [spec/FEATURES.md](spec/FEATURES.md). Groups below are sized to fit one session each.

### Group: Web Settings batch

Same screen, shared prefs plumbing — do all three in one pass.

#### #30 — Web: Settings missing reader font-size control `[ ]`

The web Settings screen does not expose a default reader font size, even though `UserPrefs.fontSize` is wired and the reader honors it. READ-5 and SET-1 both fail because of this.

**Acceptance criteria**
- The web Settings → Reading section includes a segmented control for reader font size (range 14–24px, matching the design's discrete steps; align with the Android picker options once #29's Android spec is settled).
- Changing the value persists via `UserPrefs` and the open reader pane re-renders at the new size without reload.
- A `:web:jsTest` asserts the control reflects and writes back the stored value.

#### #31 — Web: Settings missing density control `[ ]`

The web Settings page omits the "Density" segmented control (compact/regular/comfy). The article-list rows currently render at a fixed density. SET-4 fails on web for this reason.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Web Settings → Reading exposes Density (compact/regular/comfy).
- The article list reads `UserPrefs.density` and applies the row-padding/excerpt-visibility/thumbnail rules from [spec/VISUAL_SPEC.md](spec/VISUAL_SPEC.md).
- A `:web:jsTest` covers the rendering of at least one row in each density.

#### #32 — Web: drop Server URL setting `[ ]`

The web client's Settings includes a "Server URL" row, but it has no production value — in deployment the client is served by the same origin, and in development we can hardcode `http://localhost:3000/` (or whatever the dev URL is). SET-6 reports the row as broken on web; the resolution is to remove it rather than fix it.

**Acceptance criteria**
- The Server URL row is removed from the web Settings screen.
- The web client uses a fixed base URL (same-origin in production, dev-time default in development). No setting, no `ServerUrlStore` read path on web.
- Android keeps its Server URL setting unchanged — this is web-only.
- The Account section on web still shows "Signed in as: …" and logout; just no URL row.

---

### Group: Web UI bugs

#### #28 — Web: subscription overflow menu clipped + rename field empty `[ ]`

Two issues on the Subscriptions screen's per-row `⋯` menu:

1. The dropdown is constrained to the `subs-feed-list` container and gets clipped instead of overflowing on top. It should render in a layer that is not bound by the list's overflow context (portal/absolute positioning relative to the viewport, or an `overflow: visible` parent).
2. The rename dialog's text input starts empty. It should be prepopulated with the feed's current `custom_title ?: title` and the input selected so the user can either edit incrementally or overwrite.

**Acceptance criteria**
- The `⋯` menu renders above adjacent rows and is not clipped, regardless of where in the list the row sits.
- Opening "Rename" pre-fills the input with the current name and selects the text.
- A `:web:jsTest` asserts the rename input's initial value.

#### #29 — Reader: article URL should be a hyperlink `[ ]`

On the web reader pane, the feed/article URL displayed in the footer (or the `↗ Open` action target) shows as plain text in some surfaces — it should be a real `<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">` so the user can click through. (Already covered by the design's "Open externally" action; the regression is that the URL text itself is not anchored.)

**Acceptance criteria**
- Wherever a feed/article URL is rendered in the web reader, it is a clickable link that opens in a new tab.
- A `:web:jsTest` asserts the DOM contains an anchor with the expected href.

---

### Group: Auth flows

Login surface and session-signal handling. #25 and #34 explicitly pair.

#### #25 — Web: persist login session across page reloads `[ ]`

Reloading the web app always returns the user to the login screen even when a valid auth cookie is present. The web client does not currently check session validity (or the presence of credentials) on boot before routing to login.

**Acceptance criteria**
- On page load, the web client probes for an existing session (e.g. via a lightweight authenticated endpoint or by trusting a presence flag in storage and letting the first API call validate it) and routes to the Feed screen if authenticated.
- Hard reload while logged in does not bounce the user back to the login form.
- Logout clears whatever signal is used so the next reload returns to login.
- A `:web:jsTest` covers the boot-time auth check.

#### #26 — Auth form keyboard ergonomics `[ ]`

The login form is keyboard-hostile on both clients.

- **Web:** pressing Enter from inside the password field does not submit the form. The form should submit on Enter from either field.
- **Android:** the username field's IME action should advance focus to the password field (currently inserts a newline), and the password field's IME action should submit. The on-screen keyboard should expose a primary action ("Login"/"Done") that performs the submission.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Web: Enter from username or password submits the login form.
- Android: username IME action = Next (advances to password); password IME action = Done/Go (submits). Newlines are no longer inserted.
- A unit/UI test per platform asserts the keyboard-driven submission path.

#### #34 — 401 response should redirect to login on both clients `[ ]`

ERR-3: after the server's JWT secret rotates (or the cookie is otherwise invalidated), neither client redirects to the login screen on the next 401 — they sit on a screen that silently fails. Should be a single, debounced redirect to login that clears whatever local session signal exists.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Any API call returning 401 triggers a single redirect to the login screen on both clients.
- No infinite-loop: a 401 on the login probe itself does not re-enter the redirect.
- Existing local session signal (cookie presence flag, repository state, etc.) is cleared as part of the redirect.
- A test per client covers the 401 → login path. Pairs naturally with #25.

---

### Group: Read-state surfaces

Both hit the same `PUT /v1/articles/{id}/read` endpoint and share the badge/dot optimistic-update plumbing.

#### #40 — Mark-read affordance on article rows and in the reader `[ ]`

[spec/FEATURES.md](spec/FEATURES.md)'s FEED-8 and READ-7 both depend on a single read-toggle surface that hits `PUT /v1/articles/{id}/read` with the inverted flag. The row-level button sits next to the unread dot; the reader-level button lives in the reader's action group (web: next to `↗ Open` / `⎙ Share`; Android: next to `⎙ Share`). Both surfaces share the same source of truth, optimistically update the unread dot and badge, and on the Unread route the row stays in place until the next refresh.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Clicking/tapping the row-level affordance fires the PUT and decrements the Unread badge by one; the unread dot disappears.
- The reader-level button reflects the article's current read state (label "Mark unread" when read, "Mark read" when unread) and inverts on press.
- The Unread view does not optimistically drop the article; it stays put until the next list refresh.
- Tests cover both surfaces on both clients (web `:web:jsTest`, Android JVM test through [ServerRule](app/src/test/java/eu/monniot/feed/integration/ServerRule.kt)).

#### #41 — "Mark as read on scroll" pref + behaviour `[ ]`

[spec/FEATURES.md](spec/FEATURES.md)'s Settings reference lists `markOnScroll` as a stored preference (default `on`). The semantics: when on, an article row that stays visible for ≥1 s in the list flips to read (same PUT as #40). Currently the preference is neither persisted nor honoured by the list.

**Acceptance criteria**
- The Settings page exposes an on/off toggle bound to `UserPrefs.markOnScroll`.
- When on, an article row visible in the viewport for ≥1 s flips to read via the same endpoint #40 uses; the badge updates; the unread dot disappears.
- When off, scrolling has no effect on read state.
- A `:web:jsTest` and an Android JVM test cover both directions of the toggle.

---

### Group: Android refresh

#### #33 — Android: pull-to-refresh on article lists `[ ]`

Android has no manual refresh affordance on the Feed/Saved screens; ERR-1 cannot be exercised. Add pull-to-refresh.

**Acceptance criteria**
- A swipe-down gesture on the Feed and Saved article lists triggers `FeedViewModel.refresh()`.
- A spinner / progress indicator displays during the refresh, dismisses on completion or error.
- On error the sidebar/header footer reflects the "Last sync failed · retry" state (see also ERR-1).
- A Compose UI test (Robolectric or instrumented — instrumented is fine if Robolectric struggles with the SwipeRefresh widget) covers the gesture.

---

### Group: Cross-client server-backed prefs

Each adds a server endpoint plus a client read/write. Pick a session per ticket — server schema/endpoint changes don't want to compete for review attention.

#### #37 — "Keep articles" retention driven by the client setting `[ ]`

The Settings → Keep articles control (30d / 90d / 1y / forever) is shown in both clients but nothing reads it today. Wire it as a **client → server** preference: the value the user sets on either client persists to the server and replaces the server's current fixed-config retention sweep. Single-user product → single global value. Scenario SET-8 in [spec/FEATURES.md](spec/FEATURES.md) is the acceptance shape.

**Acceptance criteria — server**
- A new endpoint, e.g. `GET /v1/settings/retention` and `PUT /v1/settings/retention`, returns/accepts `{ "days": <int> | null }` where `null` ≡ "forever".
- The value is persisted (new `settings` table or a key/value row in an existing settings store — pick the smaller change).
- The server's article-cleanup sweep reads this value at each tick. If the value is missing (fresh DB), it falls back to whatever the config file currently specifies.
- A server-side test covers the endpoint + the sweep honoring the persisted value (including the `forever` case which performs no deletions).

**Acceptance criteria — clients**
- Both clients query the endpoint on Settings screen mount; the displayed value reflects the server's truth.
- Changing the control on either client writes the new value before navigating away (optimistic UI is fine; rollback on PUT failure).
- A client-side test per platform covers the read/write round-trip.

#### #38 — Refresh interval (client-side auto-poll) `[ ]`

The Settings → Refresh interval control (15m / 1h / 6h / manual) persists a value but no client polls. Wire a client-side timer. Scenario SET-9 in [spec/FEATURES.md](spec/FEATURES.md) is the acceptance shape.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Each client polls the article-list endpoints at the configured cadence (15m / 1h / 6h). `manual` disables the poll entirely.
- The poll is paused while the app/tab is backgrounded and resumed on foreground (web: `visibilitychange`; android: lifecycle `onStop` / `onStart`).
- Errors during a background poll surface via the ERR-1 path (sidebar footer on web; snackbar on android) — they do not interrupt the user's current screen.
- A test per platform covers both the cadence (use a virtual clock / `TestDispatcher` rather than real time) and the pause/resume.

#### #39 — Surface server version on Settings → About `[ ]`

[spec/FEATURES.md](spec/FEATURES.md)'s Settings reference and SET-7 specify an About row on both clients showing `Client v<x> · Server v<y>`. Today the row is missing on web and Android doesn't surface the server version.

**Acceptance criteria — server**
- A new lightweight endpoint exposes the server version — e.g. `GET /v1/version` returning `{ "version": "<x.y.z>" }`, pulled from `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")` at compile time. (Or extend the existing health endpoint with a version field — pick whichever is smaller.)
- The endpoint requires no authentication (so the About row works even on a stale session — fits the AUTH-5 spirit).
- A server-side test asserts the response shape.

**Acceptance criteria — clients**
- Both Settings screens render an About row reading `Client v<x> · Server v<y>` (`x` = client version baked at build time, `y` = response from `/v1/version`).
- On failure to reach the server, the row reads `Client v<x> · Server unreachable` in `ink3`.
- A unit test per platform covers both the success rendering and the unreachable fallback.

---

## P2 — Feature roadmap

Server endpoints exist; client surface is missing. Tackle after P1 so the existing surfaces are spec-clean first.

### #4 — Categories UI and filtering `[ ]`

Server supports categories with reorder and nested-with-feeds responses. Client has none of it.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Categories can be created, renamed, deleted, reordered from a "Categories" screen.
- Feeds can be assigned to a category (from #3's feed detail/edit flow).
- The home article list can be filtered to: All / Uncategorized / a specific category. Filter persists across launches.
- Deleting a category does not delete its feeds (server already handles `ON DELETE SET NULL`); confirm UX matches.

---

### #5 — Full-text search UI `[ ]`

`GET /v1/articles/search` (FTS5) is implemented server-side and unused.

**Acceptance criteria**
- A search entry point (top app bar icon or pull-down) on the article list.
- Submitting a query hits `/articles/search` with debouncing (≥250ms) and shows results.
- Result rows show the snippet returned by the server (with the `<b>` highlights rendered or stripped — pick one and be consistent).
- Optional: a feed filter on the search screen (the endpoint accepts `feed_id`).

---

### #7 — Stats / health dashboard `[ ]`

`GET /v1/stats` and `GET /v1/feeds/health` exist and are unused.

**Acceptance criteria**
- A "Dashboard" or "Stats" screen shows totals (feeds, articles, unread, starred) and trends (24h/7d/30d, plus daily counts).
- A feed-health section flags feeds with errors, paused feeds, and never-fetched feeds — with a tap-through to the feed's detail/edit screen (#3).
- The screen pulls fresh data on each navigation; no caching needed.

Note: the "starred" total can be dropped from the acceptance criteria now that #35 removed the feature.

---

### #9 — Batch read operations `[ ]`

Server supports `mark-all-read`, `mark-feed-read`, and batch `articles/read`. Client only marks one at a time via swipe.

**Acceptance criteria**
- "Mark all as read" action on the home screen (with confirmation if unread count > some threshold, e.g. 50).
- "Mark feed as read" from the feed detail screen (#3).
- Selection mode on the article list allows multi-select → batch mark-read via `/articles/read`.
- Local Room cache is updated to match server state (or evicted, matching current single-row pattern).

---

## P3 — Infra hygiene

### #15 — Add LICENSE file `[ ]`

[server/README.md:418](server/README.md#L418) references "MIT License - see the LICENSE file" but no such file exists. (~15 minutes.)

**Acceptance criteria**
- A `LICENSE` file exists at repo root with chosen license text.
- Top-level README references it.
- Server README's existing reference resolves to a real file.

---

### #10 — First-run DB bootstrap `[ ]`

[server/src/main.rs:74](server/src/main.rs#L74) carries a TODO: the server doesn't have a clean path when no SQLite DB exists at the resolved path. SQLx's connection options need `create_if_missing` or the directory needs to exist.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Running the binary on a clean system with no DB file creates it (and any missing parent directory) at the path returned by `Config::database_url()`.
- A clear log line confirms first-run setup (so the user knows what happened).
- Existing-DB behaviour is unchanged.
- An integration test covers the cold-start case.

---

### #17 — CI on GitHub Actions `[ ]`

No CI exists. Easy to regress. The local test environment is now trustworthy (see [.claude/plans/test-environment-hardening.md](.claude/plans/test-environment-hardening.md)) — `cargo test` and `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest` both run clean, and the gradle task auto-builds the server binary the Android integration tests need.

**Acceptance criteria**
- A workflow runs `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy -D warnings`, and `cargo test` on every push/PR.
- A workflow runs `./gradlew assembleDebug` and `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest` for the Android module. The existing `:app:buildServerBinary` task means no extra orchestration is needed — gradle will build the server before the Android tests run.
- Workflow files are committed to `.github/workflows/`.

---

### #16 — Real Dockerfile + image build `[ ]`

The server README shows an example Dockerfile but nothing is wired up.

**Acceptance criteria**
- A `Dockerfile` (or `server/Dockerfile`) at the repo produces a working server image.
- Multi-stage build keeps the runtime image slim (Debian slim or distroless).
- The image runs as non-root.
- Config and DB paths are volume-mountable; `FEED_JWT_SECRET` env var override works.
- A README section documents `docker run` with a real example.
- Optional: a `docker-compose.yml` for single-command bring-up.

---

### #24 — Contract tests between client models and server JSON `[ ]`

Natural follow-up to #23. The shared client models ([`Models.kt`](shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/eu/monniot/feed/shared/api/Models.kt)) and the server's serialized response shapes ([`server/src/db.rs`](server/src/db.rs), [`server/src/api/types.rs`](server/src/api/types.rs)) drift independently. The bug fixed in this commit: the client `Article` required a `read_at` field the server never emits → `MissingFieldException` swallowed → silently empty article list. With `ignoreUnknownKeys = true` only the "extra fields" direction is guarded; "missing fields" / "type changed" still blow up at runtime.

`ArticleModelTest` added alongside the fix covers the `Article` model. This ticket is about systematic coverage of the remaining endpoints.

**Acceptance criteria**
- For each REST endpoint the client calls (feed list, categories, stats, search, …), a test deserializes a representative server-shaped JSON into the client model without throwing.
- Fixtures or inline JSON strings live in `shared/src/commonTest/`.
- Ideally a server-side Rust test generates the same fixtures from real Rust structs so the two sides stay in sync; a simpler alternative is a test that calls a live test server and decodes one real response.

---

### #22 — Investigate the `#[ignore]`'d db tests `[ ]`

Several tests in [server/src/db_tests.rs](server/src/db_tests.rs) were marked `#[ignore]` during the test-hardening pass because their assertions don't match current behavior. Some may be real bugs in the server, others stale test expectations. Untriaged. (Post-#35 the count is 5 ignored, down from 6; refresh the inventory when picking this up.)

The remaining suspects:
- `test_search_articles_not_logic` — FTS5 NOT operator returns more rows than expected.
- `test_get_all_webhooks` — filtering returns more rows than expected.
- `test_get_article_count_since` — count off by one or boundary handling.
- `test_get_daily_article_counts` — daily bucket count mismatch.
- `test_delete_old_articles` — retention cleanup doesn't delete what the test expected.

(`test_get_starred_articles` was retired with the rest of the starring code in #35. `test_cleanup_expired_refresh_tokens` was deleted as part of the Phase 0 cookie-auth migration that dropped the `refresh_tokens` table.)

**Acceptance criteria**
- For each test: determine whether the test is wrong or the implementation is wrong, fix the appropriate side, remove the `#[ignore]`.
- `cargo test` reports `0 ignored` (or higher passing count if new tests are added in the process).
- Any genuine bugs found in server code are noted in the commit message.

---

### #20 — `data_extraction_rules.xml` TODO `[ ]`

[app/src/main/res/xml/data_extraction_rules.xml:8](app/src/main/res/xml/data_extraction_rules.xml#L8) carries the scaffold TODO about `<include>`/`<exclude>`.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Decide what should and should not be in cloud/device backups (tokens? Room cache?) — likely: exclude the token DataStore and Tink keyset, allow everything else.
- File has explicit rules (no TODO), and a one-line comment explaining the choice.

---

## P4 — Deferred investigations

Low priority; pick up only when context warrants (touching nearby code, scaling pain, etc.).

### #14 — Migration framework (deferred) `[ ]`

[server/src/db.rs:128-482](server/src/db.rs#L128-L482) chains ten inline `if version < N { ... }` blocks. Works today, gets awkward as it grows.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Migrations live in their own files (e.g. `migrations/0001_initial.sql`) and are applied either via `sqlx::migrate!` or a small bespoke runner.
- Existing databases at any current `schema_version` (1-10) upgrade cleanly without data loss.
- `Database::new` becomes substantially shorter.
- Low priority — defer until adding migration #11 actually hurts.

---

### #21 — Investigate Metro DI (deferred) `[ ]`

The top-level README has a note pondering whether to adopt [Metro](https://zacsweers.github.io/metro/latest/quickstart/) for DI. Currently DI is hand-rolled in `FeedApplication` + ViewModel `Factory`.

**Acceptance criteria** (when picked up)
- A short ADR-style note in the repo explains the decision (yes / no / not yet) and why.
- If yes: a single screen migrated as proof, with the rest of the migration tracked as a follow-up ticket.
- Low priority — revisit only once the Android side has noticeably more classes (post-#3/#4/#5).

---

### #36 — Investigate feed-hue collisions `[ ]`

SUBS-5 noted that two feeds with different names rendered the same avatar hue. The hue derivation is `abs(id.hashCode()) % 360` (Phase 1 implementation uses `ushr 1` to avoid `Int.MIN_VALUE` overflow), keyed off feed id, so identical hues across two ids are plausible at small N but worth checking — are we seeding from the right field, and is the modulo bucketing producing visible clashes on typical id ranges?

**Acceptance criteria**
- Audit `FeedHue` against real feed ids from a populated server; document whether observed collisions are at the expected rate.
- If the rate is unacceptable, switch to a better mixing function (e.g. xxhash of the feed's URL or title rather than the id's `hashCode()`), or shift to a curated palette of N hues distributed around the wheel.
- A unit test pins the chosen mapping so future changes are deliberate.

---

## Needs verification

### #8 — OPML import UI `[?]`

`POST /v1/feeds/import/opml` is implemented server-side. The ticket was filed when no client entry point existed, but [spec/FEATURES.md](spec/FEATURES.md) SET-5 currently lists OPML import as ✓ on both clients and the Settings reference table marks "Account → Import OPML" as ✓. **Action:** confirm both client surfaces exist and the file-picker → POST → summary-dialog flow works end-to-end, then flip to `[x]`. If a client surface is actually missing, drop the `[?]` back to `[ ]` and keep the original acceptance criteria below.

**Acceptance criteria (original)**
- A "Import OPML" action in Settings (or the Feeds screen from #3) opens a file picker for `.opml` / `.xml` files.
- The file body is POSTed as-is to the server.
- The summary response (`imported` / `already_exists` / `failed` / `categories_created`) is rendered in a result dialog or screen.
- Failures per feed (from the response's `feeds` list) are scrollable so the user can inspect what didn't import.

---

## Closed without action

### #6 — Starring / favorites UI `[-]`

Superseded by #35. Star toggle, `is_starred` / `starred_at` columns, and the "Starred" filter are no longer part of the product — see [spec/FEATURES.md](spec/FEATURES.md) under "Features explicitly NOT supported". Do not reintroduce.

---

## Done

### #1 — Configurable server URL `[x]`

Resolved. The URL now lives in a sibling DataStore ([ServerUrlStore.kt](app/src/main/java/eu/monniot/feed/api/ServerUrlStore.kt)) and a new [BaseUrlInterceptor](app/src/main/java/eu/monniot/feed/api/NetworkModule.kt) rewrites each request's scheme/host/port from the provider on every call, so URL changes take effect on the next request without rebuilding any API clients. A dedicated `ServerConfigScreen` is reachable both from `Settings → Server URL` and a "Server: …" button on the login screen. `FeedViewModel.login()` now distinguishes `IOException` (unreachable → "Cannot reach server at …") from `HttpException` (401 → "Invalid username or password"). Default remains `http://10.0.2.2:3000/`. Normalization handles missing scheme, missing trailing slash, whitespace, and rejects non-http URLs — covered by `ServerUrlStoreTest` (9 cases) and `BaseUrlInterceptorTest` (3 cases).

---

### #2 — Show real feed title on article list `[x]`

Resolved. `FeedRepository.refresh()` now makes one `getFeeds()` call alongside `getArticles()`, builds a `feed_id → custom_title ?: title` map, and joins client-side via a new pure `toEntities(articles, feedTitlesById)` helper. `RssItemEntity` gained a nullable `feedTitle` column (Room v2→v3 migration: `ALTER TABLE rss_items ADD COLUMN feedTitle TEXT`, leaves existing rows NULL). `RssItem.feedTitle` is displayed in the article row instead of the hardcoded "Feed"; the ViewModel maps NULL to "Unknown" so legacy offline rows render gracefully until the next refresh fills them in. Covered by `ToEntitiesTest` (5 cases) plus the existing `FeedRepositoryTest` which now exercises the full join + insert path against the real server.

---

### #3 — Feed management UI `[x]`

Resolved. A `FeedsScreen` is reachable from the home screen's TopAppBar (RssFeed icon). `FeedRepository` gained four new methods (`getFeeds`, `addFeed`, `updateFeed`, `deleteFeed`); `updateFeed` always sends all three mutable fields to avoid serde-default clobbering on the server's PUT endpoint. `FeedViewModel` exposes five new `StateFlow`s and eight action methods (`loadFeeds`, `addFeed`, `renameFeed`, `setFeedInterval`, `toggleFeedPaused`, `deleteFeed`, plus two error-clear methods). The screen handles the empty state (CTA to add first feed), shows a FAB/icon to open an add-feed dialog (inline verbatim server errors on 400), and per-feed actions via a MoreVert dropdown: rename (pre-filled `AlertDialog`), set interval (numeric input, client-side ≥5 guard), pause/resume (label flips), and delete (error-colored confirm dialog). Covered by `FeedRepositoryFeedsTest` (11 cases) and `FeedViewModelFeedsTest` (15 cases), using a new `MockRssServer` helper (OkHttp MockWebServer) so the Rust subprocess can fetch a local RSS fixture for success-path tests.

---

### #11 — Test file housekeeping `[x]`

Resolved in the test-environment-hardening pass (see [.claude/plans/test-environment-hardening.md](.claude/plans/test-environment-hardening.md)). `db_tests.rs` is re-enabled with 86 passing tests and 7 `#[ignore]`'d ones tracked in #22. `fetcher_tests_simple.rs` was promoted to canonical `fetcher_tests.rs`; a fresh `scheduler_tests.rs` was written against the real function signatures. All `_simple`/`_working` suffixed files are gone. `cargo test` reports `93 passed; 0 failed; 7 ignored`.

---

### #12 — Remove `server/test.db` from the repo `[x]`

Resolved in the test-environment-hardening pass. `server/test.db` and `server/config.toml` turned out to never have been tracked in git history — they were only present in the working tree. `.gitignore` now has `server/*.db` and `server/config.toml` to prevent future accidents.

---

### #13 — `config.toml` should not be in the repo `[x]`

Resolved alongside #12 — `server/config.toml` was never tracked in git history. `.gitignore` now covers it. No credential rotation needed since the file never reached the remote. `config.example.toml` remains as the template.

---

### #18 — Update top-level README `[x]`

Resolved alongside the cross-platform support work (branch `crossplatform-support`). [README.md](README.md) now covers the three-module architecture, quick-start for all three clients, feature list, and API link. A new [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) covers prerequisites, build commands, test commands, and module-by-module guidance for contributors. [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) updated to reflect new module layout and test baselines.

---

### #19 — `androidTest` scaffold cleanup `[x]`

Resolved in the test-environment-hardening pass. `ExampleInstrumentedTest.kt` and `ExampleUnitTest.kt` deleted. `app/src/androidTest/` kept with a `.gitkeep` so the source set is preserved for future instrumented tests.

---

### #23 — Surface refresh / API errors in dev `[x]`

Resolved. Added a shared `Logger` (`shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/eu/monniot/feed/shared/util/Logger.kt`) with platform actuals — Android delegates to `android.util.Log.e`, JS to `console.error`, wasmJs to `console.error` via `@JsFun`. Every `catch (_: Exception)` block in [`FeedViewModel`](shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/eu/monniot/feed/shared/FeedViewModel.kt) now binds the exception and calls `Logger.e(TAG, "<action> failed", e)` before mapping to the existing user-facing message — user-facing strings are unchanged. The repository layers had no `catch` blocks to update. `Logger.sink` is a `var` so tests can capture log invocations. Covered by `FeedViewModelErrorLoggingTest` (6 cases) verifying refresh, markAsRead, loadFeeds, addFeed (non-HTTP path), loadCategories, and importOpml all route the throwable through `Logger` before producing their error state.

### #35 — Remove starring / favorites end-to-end `[x]`

Resolved in commit `787897c`. Server dropped `is_starred` / `starred_at` columns plus the `PUT /v1/articles/{id}/star` and `GET /v1/articles/starred` routes via a schema-version migration. The shared KMP layer dropped `toggleStarred` / `getStarred` from `FeedRepository` and `FeedApi`. Android removed the ★ button from `ReaderScreen` / `ArticleRow`, the `SavedTabPlaceholder`, and the "Saved" bottom-nav tab; the "Today" label flipped to "Unread". Web removed `Route.Starred`, the sidebar "Starred" entry, the `reader-star-btn`, `starredItems` subscription, and `WebFeedRepository.toggleStarred` / `getStarred` / `isStarred`. All starring-related tests deleted. Post-change test counts: server 95 passed (5 ignored — see #22), android 102 passed, shared-js / shared-wasmjs 73 each, web 88 passed. Closes #6 by supersession; FEATURES.md's "Features explicitly NOT supported" enshrines the decision.

To be fleshed out at a later point

- server/config.example.toml isn't fully up to date (missing database group for example)
- ~~Write a set of scripts to analyze test results instead of having claude run find/exec things that require my approval.~~ Resolved — see [scripts/](scripts/) (`test-counts.sh`, `test-run.sh`, `test-failures.sh`, `server-build.sh`), documented in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#helper-scripts) and allowlisted via [.claude/settings.local.json](.claude/settings.local.json) (`Bash(./scripts/*:*)` plus fixed prefix syntax for `cargo:*`, `grep:*`, etc.).
